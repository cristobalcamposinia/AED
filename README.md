# AED

Package accompanying 2009 book by Zuur et. al. (Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R). AED stands for "Analyzing ecological data".

Please do not contact author(s) of the book about this package on GitHub, as this is an 'unofficial' (but with blessing from the first author) version for your convenience.

This is work in progress and in time, all the datasets and functions will be documented and added. If you feel you can contribute or are willing to learn how, by adding `roxygen2` documentation for data sets (see examples in /R), drop me a line at roman.lustrik@biolitika.si.
