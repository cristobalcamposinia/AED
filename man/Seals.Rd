\details{
Common seal (\emph{Phoca vitulina} L.) data comes from Cronin et al. 2007, where between April 2003 and November 2005, regular
standardised haul-out count survey of Bantry Bay and Kenmare River was carried out by boat. Counts of seals at each haul-out
site was carried out independently and simultaneously by two observers, initially from 200 m and progressively closer. Read
more about the data in Zuur et al. 2007 in chapter 23 (page 503) or in above mentioned Cronin et al. 2007 paper.
